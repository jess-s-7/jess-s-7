# About me
- 💻 I’m currently learning the arcane art of API documentation.
- 🤸‍♀️ I’m looking to collaborate on opensource technical writing API documentation. 
- 🧘‍♀️ Pronouns: she/her
- 🎲 I’m currently working on my newest tabletop RPG game. I'd like to explore grief and how we move through loss both together and with companions, and I'd like to do it with dice.
